We are developing a Souls Like, Metroidvania, 3D, and First Person game with a team of five.
The game combines the challenging combat mechanics of Souls Like with the interconnected, exploration-driven level design of Metroidvania.
Players will navigate through a carefully crafted world, uncovering new areas and secrets as they acquire new abilities.

Unlike open-world games, our game is structured with distinct interconnected levels, where progression is tightly linked to the player’s skills and exploration. 
The First Person perspective adds a unique immersive experience to the fast-paced combat and puzzle-solving elements. 
By mastering the intense combat system and discovering hidden paths, players will delve deeper into the game’s rich environments and intense challenges.

Its the plan I hope we can make it if you want to help us you can mail me.

Praise the sun!
